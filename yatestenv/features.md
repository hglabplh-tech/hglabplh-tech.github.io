# Features

YATestEnvironment is a Clojure and Java test automation environment. It combines reflection APIs, function metadata analysis, generated test-data pipelines, spying and mocking utilities, and early code-generation research.

## Status Legend

- **Available**: implemented and exercised by repository tests or smoke tests.
- **In progress**: wired into the project, but still needs API hardening, dependency activation, or broader test coverage.
- **Experimental**: research/prototype code that should not yet be treated as a stable public API.

## Core Purpose

**Available**

- Provides reusable building blocks for automated tests.
- Supports generated test data from Clojure function metadata and Java reflection data.
- Helps inspect Java classes, constructors, methods, fields, annotations, generic types, modifiers, and selected special language forms.
- Provides Clojure-focused spying and mocking utilities for unit-test support.
- Includes documentation for unit testing, functional testing, performance testing, test-driven development, and entropy-oriented test design.

## Build and Runtime

**Available**

- Leiningen project published as `org.clojars.hglabplh/YATestEnvironment`.
- Uses Clojure 1.12.3.
- Compiles Java sources with Java 17 source and target settings.

- Configures source, Java source, test, and resource paths for mixed Clojure/Java development.
- Provides source and javadoc classifier configuration.

## Java Test Annotations

**Available**

- Defines a custom `@YATest` annotation for test methods and annotation types.
- Marks `@YATest` with JUnit Platform `@Testable`.
- Stores test metadata including category, test name, and implementation date.
- Provides test categories for unit, functional, smoke, black-box, and white-box tests.

## Java Reflection API

**Available**

- Loads classes by canonical class name or existing `Class` object.
- Finds classes from package scanning.
- Retrieves constructors, public constructors, methods, public methods, fields, public fields, subclasses, public subclasses, annotations, interfaces, generic interfaces, superclasses, generic superclasses, enclosing classes, enclosing methods, and enclosing constructors.
- Retrieves members by name where supported.
- Supports annotation lookup by annotation type.
- Exposes direct access to the underlying reflected `Class`.
- Provides Clojure wrappers around Java utility classes for reflection operations.

## Member and Type Inspection

**Available**

- Inspects constructor names, parameter counts, parameter types, generic parameter types, exception types, generic exception types, modifiers, and declaring classes.

**In progress**

- Captures lambda-related structures such as functional fields, functional method parameters, constructors, and capture fields.
- Captures switch-related structures such as detected switch methods, descriptors, return types, parameter types, opcodes, and counts.
- Special-form coverage is useful for smoke checks and generated structure, but lambda and switch analysis still need more complete semantic coverage.

## Clojure Function Metadata and Active Data Support

**Available**

- Provides helpers for inspecting Active Data realm structures.
- Handles realm forms including scalar, integer range, real range, union, intersection, sequence, set, map, enum, tuple, record, function, delayed, and named realms.

**In progress**

- Some Active Data parsing branches are marked with FIXME comments and need cleanup around edge cases and realm predicate handling.

## Clojure Function Spying

**Available**

- Provides function spying through `prolog` and `spy`.
- Marks target functions with spy metadata before instrumentation.
- Preserves original function execution while adding metadata and runtime recording.
- Captures call-flow information for instrumented functions.
- Captures stack-trace context to identify invocation locations.

- Marks target functions with mock metadata before instrumentation.
- Rebinds namespace public vars while keeping original function references for restoration.
- Supports conditional mock rules with `call-cond->`.
- Supports rule matching by return predicate and parameter predicates.
- Includes built-in predicate keys for boolean, byte, char, collection, double, float, int, list, long, map, object, set, typed set, short, string, and vararg values.
- Provides mock actions for returning a value, throwing an exception, or doing nothing.
- Records mocked call flow as function name, argument values, and return value.

## Generated Test-Data Pipeline

**Available**

- Loads Clojure source files and derives their declared namespace symbols.
- Analyzes public Clojure functions using function metadata and schema information.
- Analyzes Java classes and methods through the project reflection API.
- Normalizes Clojure functions and Java methods into a shared generated-test-data model.
- Infers parameter value categories such as boolean, string, integer, number, UUID, symbol, set, map, function, and generic values.

- Provides a registry of hook points for classes, constructors, methods, fields, enums, records, lambdas, switches, and final emission.
- Includes JSON, XML, YAML, and Java-like generator namespaces.

**In progress**

- The hook-based generator walks compiled class data and dispatches to the active registry.
- The JSON, XML, YAML, and Java-like outputs are useful as generated structural output, but they should still be treated as a foundation rather than a complete source-code generator.
- Some namespace/path compatibility needs consolidation between older and newer reflection/code generation namespaces.
