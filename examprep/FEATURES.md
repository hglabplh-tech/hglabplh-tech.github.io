# HGPExamWorkFlowAndChat feature inventory

This document describes the implemented project features and their important
attributes as detected from the current source tree. The project is alpha
software and should still be reviewed, threat-modeled, configured, and
integration-tested before production use.

## 1. Platform architecture

**Purpose:** provide a modular Python/FastAPI learning, chat, search, exam, and
grading service.

**Attributes**

- Backend: FastAPI route modules under `backend/app/api_routes/`.
- Business services: `backend/app/services/`.
- Persistence: PostgreSQL ORM models under `backend/app/db_models/`.
- Frontend: responsive HTML5/PWA client in `frontend/`.
- Native packaging: Capacitor/Tauri wrapper in `clients/native/`.
- ML experiments: standalone scripts in `ml/`.
- Infrastructure: Caddy TLS proxy, PostgreSQL setup, migrations, OCSP config.
- Canonical data store: PostgreSQL; ChromaDB is treated as a rebuildable
  semantic index.
- Static hygiene: unused imports, unused locals, and accidental redefinitions
  are checked with Ruff.

## 2. Authentication, registration, and active sessions

**Purpose:** authenticate users through administrator-created accounts, user
self-registration, TOTP delivery, bearer sessions, nonces, and optional client
certificate binding.

## 23. Important operational configuration

**Selected settings**

- `NONCE_TTL_SECONDS`
- `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`
- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USERNAME`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `EMAIL_FROM`
- `SMS_GATEWAY_URL`, `SMS_GATEWAY_TOKEN`
- `REGISTRATION_ACTIVATION_MINUTES`
- `CHROMA_URL`
- `EU_DSS_VALIDATOR_URL`

- `TRAINING_INTERVAL_HOURS`

## 24. Known implementation boundaries

- SMTP and SMS delivery require deployment configuration.
- EU qualified-signature validation depends on an external DSS service.
- ChromaDB is a derived index. It can be rebuilt from PostgreSQL through the
  admin UI or `POST /api/v1/knowledge/rebuild-chroma`, but the Chroma service
  itself must be reachable and healthy.
- In-process WebSocket broadcasting should be replaced with Redis/NATS before
  multi-replica scaling.
- Legal holds, backups, immutable storage, and certified retention require
  operational controls beyond application code.
- The backend compatibility endpoint `get_fresh_totp` exists, but the login UI
  now uses `send_totp` so TOTP values are delivered through the selected channel
  instead of displayed by the browser button.
