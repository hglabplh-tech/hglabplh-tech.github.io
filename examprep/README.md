# HGPExamWorkFlowAndChat

A cloud-ready Python service for course chat, curated documents and videos,
hybrid search, secure examination submissions, assisted grading, and independent
ML experiments. The project is currently **alpha software**, not a certified
grading, qualified-signature, or records-management product.

## Boundaries

- `frontend/`: responsive HTML5 Progressive Web App (one UI for phones, tablets, and desktops)
- `backend/app/api.py` and `api_routes/`: small, versioned REST route modules
- `backend/app/db_models/`: PostgreSQL models split by business area
- `backend/app/services/`: scoring, search, evidence, trust, reporting, and ML utilities
- `backend/app/workflows/`: pure exam-state and chat-visibility policies
- `clients/`: independent Python REST client
- `clients/native/`: Capacitor Android/iOS and Tauri Windows wrappers for the HTML5 client
- `ml/`: BERT fine-tuning and educational LSTM training
- `data/sample_courses/`: two reviewable example course definitions
- `data/training/`: synthetic ASAG examples for pipeline development
- `infra/`: TLS proxy and database setup

ChromaDB is a derived semantic index. PostgreSQL remains canonical, including
approval status and provenance, so the index can always be rebuilt and audited.

## Run locally

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace `JWT_SECRET`.
2. Put a development certificate and key in `certs/server.crt` and `certs/server.key`.
3. Run `docker compose up --build`.
4. Create the first administrator inside the API container:
   `python -m backend.app.bootstrap admin@example.org 'a-long-password'`.
5. Open `https://localhost`. Interactive API documentation is at `/docs`.

For development without TLS termination, run PostgreSQL and Chroma with Compose,
then start `uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload`. Never expose that port publicly.

## Build and deployment

The application is packaged as an OCI/Docker image containing Python 3.12,
FastAPI, Uvicorn, OpenSSL, and all runtime dependencies. Use Docker Compose for
development or a single-server installation:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
make up
```

For cloud production, push a version tag to publish an image to GitHub Container
Registry, replace `OWNER` and the example host names in `deploy/kubernetes/`,
create the application and OCSP secrets, and apply the manifests. Kubernetes is
language-neutral; a Deployment is appropriate for the stateless Python API,
while PostgreSQL, Chroma, object storage, and model storage should be managed
services or separately operated stateful workloads.

The provided deployment starts with one API replica. Before scaling out, replace
the in-process WebSocket room broadcaster with Redis/NATS pub-sub, move startup
schema changes to an Alembic migration Job, and use shared model/object storage.
The GitHub workflows test Python 3.11/3.12 with coverage, build the image, and publish tagged
releases to GHCR with provenance and an SBOM.

## Native client apps

The HTML5 client can be packaged as Android, iOS, macOS DMG, and Windows apps
without duplicating the UI. The native wrappers live in `clients/native/`;
Android and iOS use Capacitor, while macOS and Windows use Tauri. Build the
static bundle with the cloud API origin:

```sh
export HCP_API_BASE="https://study.example.edu"
make client-bundle
```

Then use the platform-specific commands documented in
`docs/client-app-builds.md`, for example `make client-android-sync`,
`make client-ios-sync`, `make client-macos-dmg-silicon`,
`make client-macos-dmg-intel`, `make client-macos-dmg-universal`, or
`make client-windows-build` after installing the required local SDKs.

## Sample courses and tests

The repository includes `CS-M3-101`, covering supported ARM64, profiling, concurrency,
unified-memory, and Metal development on Apple Silicon M3, plus `HIST-DE-1949`, covering
German history since 1949. Their accompanying CSV answer sets are intentionally synthetic.
They are examples for ingestion and nightly-training tests, not sufficiently large or
independently validated model-training corpora.

Run `python -m pytest` after installing `.[dev]`. Tests cover persistence metadata,
cryptographic evidence, password hashing, deterministic ASAG metrics, hybrid ranking,
indexing, workflow visibility, and sample-data contracts. External PostgreSQL, Chroma,
OCSP, and trust-list interoperability still require deployment-level integration tests.

## Authentication and TLS

Basic authentication is accepted only to exchange credentials for a short-lived
bearer token. Every state-changing request also needs a unique
`X-Request-Nonce`. The included Caddy configuration permits TLS 1.2 and 1.3 and
contains an optional mutual-certificate authentication block. In production use
an institutional OpenID Connect provider, managed certificates, refresh-token
rotation, and a shared nonce store such as Redis.

TLS is never replaced by Basic authentication, tokens, nonces, hashes, or digital
signatures: those mechanisms have different jobs. Client certificates can be
enabled in `infra/Caddyfile`; Caddy then forwards the verified certificate
fingerprint to the otherwise private API. Passwords use Argon2id and are stored
in the self-describing Unix/PHC modular format (`$argon2id$...`), not a legacy
DES/SHA `/etc/shadow` scheme.

## Signed examination evidence and retention

Before submission, a student registers an Ed25519 public key. Their device signs
a canonical receipt containing the exam ID, student ID, SHA-256 content digest,
client timestamp, and one-time nonce. PostgreSQL stores the original bytes,
signature, digest, nonce, server receipt timestamp, and retention deadline.
Database triggers reject mutation or physical deletion of evidence and reject
all updates/deletes to the hash-chained audit log.

Submission requires an active certificate from an enabled application trust
chain. The certificate fingerprint is bound into the student's signature. For a
real examination, return additionally requires the instructor's active
certificate and signature over the original exam hash, student-signature hash,
and final grading hash. Practice examinations deliberately have no instructor
signature and are labelled AI-only.

Both workflows generate an A4 PDF report from PostgreSQL containing each
question and answer, per-question score, ASAG metrics, feedback, evidence hashes,
certificate fingerprints, and signature fingerprints. The report bytes and
their own SHA-256 digest are retained in PostgreSQL and available from
`GET /api/v1/submissions/{id}/report.pdf` subject to feedback-release rules.

The administrative delete endpoint is deliberately a soft deletion: it requires
an explicit retention override plus a reason during an active ten-year period,
records the administrator, and preserves the evidence. Actual legally compliant
purging must be a separately approved operational workflow coordinated with
backups and immutable object storage; application code alone cannot guarantee a
legal hold or make a system impossible to compromise.

Direct and group conversations have explicit membership rows. A submission may
only be shared by its owner, and its content endpoint requires membership in the
exact conversation where it was shared.

## EU and US trust frameworks

The `/admin` screen manages customer trusted lists in ETSI TS 119 612 v5/v6
XML. Lists remain disabled until their XML signature is validated. Official EU
status cannot be set by an administrator; eIDAS validation follows the official
EU LOTL through an EU DSS 6.2+ validation service. See
`docs/trust-validation-contract.md` for its small HTTP contract and required
fail-closed behavior.

The signature API records PAdES/XAdES/CAdES/JAdES validation reports and supports
official EU, customer-private ETSI, US private-PKI, and US federal-policy modes.
NIST defines cryptographic and key-management requirements, not a universal US
root list. A customer root therefore establishes private trust, not eIDAS
qualified status or automatic US government trust.

`tools/generate_certificate_request.py` creates an encrypted ECDSA P-256 key and
CSR. The CSR must be certified by the selected CA, federal PKI, or qualified EU
trust service provider. Local key generation alone cannot create a qualified
electronic signature certificate.

Customers may instead operate a private OpenSSL PKI. Run
`tools/create_private_pki.sh <directory> <user-common-name>` to generate an
encrypted P-256 root, issuing intermediate, and user client certificate with CA
and key-usage constraints. Upload the root and intermediate through the private
PKI administration API, enable it with an audited decision, then assign the
verified user certificate. The `/api/v1/private-pki-roots.pem` API exports all
enabled roots as `customer-client-roots.pem`; mount that file into Caddy and reload Caddy after
changing the trust set. Never place root or intermediate private keys on the
application server.

OpenSSL chain validity means “trusted by this customer configuration.” It does
not imply eIDAS qualified, public WebPKI, or US federal status. Revocation lists,
OCSP, key ceremonies, offline root protection, renewal, and compromise response
remain required production PKI procedures.

The private-PKI generator also creates a delegated OCSP responder certificate
and encrypted key. Configure the isolated signer using
`infra/ocsp-config.example.json`, set `OCSP_SIGNER_URL` and its separate service
token, and put the final `/api/v1/ocsp/{private-pki-id}` URL into issued user
certificates. The responder returns RFC 6960 `good`, `revoked`, or `unknown`
states and echoes OCSP nonces. EU certificates and signatures use DSS-managed
OCSP/CRL validation instead.

## Knowledge and coverage

Documents and YouTube resources enter an unapproved review queue. Search returns
only approved material. Empty searches emit a coverage warning, which is the
beginning of a staff dashboard for disciplines, courses, and questions with weak
or missing source coverage.

The YouTube discovery helper writes unapproved candidates to CSV:

```sh
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=... python tools/youtube_to_csv.py \
  "cellular respiration tutorial" biology-videos.csv --discipline Biology
```

## ML experiments

Install the optional packages with `pip install -e '.[ml]'`.

Fine-tune a BERT-compatible classifier from a `text,label` CSV:

```sh
python ml/train_bert.py training.csv --labels 8
```

Train a multilingual query/passage reranker from `query,passage,label` CSV data:

```sh
python ml/train_reranker.py relevance.csv --family xlm-roberta
```

Train the small character-level LSTM:

```sh
python ml/train_lstm.py approved-corpus.txt
```

The LSTM is deliberately isolated from grading and factual RAG responses: it is
useful for learning and controlled experiments, but it does not provide reliable
facts or citations. Models should be evaluated and registered before deployment.

Hybrid retrieval fuses PostgreSQL full-text results with Chroma semantic results.
The model router uses a multilingual MiniLM sentence transformer on economical
hardware, a larger multilingual MPNet profile when selected, and optionally
reranks complex queries with mBERT or XLM-RoBERTa. Device selection supports
`auto`, `cpu`, `cuda`, `mps`, or an installed PyTorch/XLA device. BERT-family
models are used for contextual reranking; sentence transformers produce the
retrieval embeddings.

Sentence-BERT (SBERT) is the sentence-embedding architecture; Sentence
Transformers is the library and broader model ecosystem used here to run it.
The ASAG implementation calls `SentenceTransformer` directly, so semantic answer
comparison is not limited to a single original SBERT checkpoint.

## Weighted ASAG grading and hybrid ranking

The administration screen creates immutable, versioned scoring profiles for each
discipline. Grading profiles combine token Jaccard overlap, required-keyword
coverage, multilingual sentence-transformer cosine similarity, expected-fact
entailment, contradiction safety, and answer-length adequacy. Every question has
a teacher reference answer, required concepts, approved facts, and maximum mark.

`POST /api/v1/submissions/{id}/ai-grade` creates a provisional score containing
every raw signal, configured weight, actually applied normalized weight, profile
version, warning, and review flag. If a model signal is unavailable, remaining
weights are renormalized and the result is flagged; a teacher still approves or
overrides the grade. Large disagreement between signals also forces review.

The same discipline profile controls search ranking. PostgreSQL full-text and
Chroma sentence-transformer results are normalized independently, multiplied by
their configured weights, and summed. Each search result returns
`score_components`, making its final rank explainable.

## End-to-end learning and examination workflow

Research questions, grounded answers, citations, visibility decisions, chat
messages, shared research, practice scores, examination states, submissions,
corrections, and returned grades are persisted in PostgreSQL. Practice exams
release immediate provisional feedback; real exams suppress all feedback until
an instructor approves and explicitly returns the grading. See
`docs/workflows.md` for the student/instructor state transitions and REST flow.

A nightly Kubernetes CronJob curates consented course-public research and
teacher-returned scoring examples. Staff moderate student research examples.
When training is enabled and enough approved examples exist, it fine-tunes the
retrieval Sentence Transformer and supervised scoring CrossEncoder and records
the resulting model run and artifact.

For a local/manual nightly run use:

```sh
docker compose --profile tools run --rm trainer
```

## Knowledge import, audio, and scheduled training

Staff can upload PDF or UTF-8 text through `POST /api/v1/knowledge/upload`, merge or
export versioned PostgreSQL bundles, or send a file and question together through
`POST /api/v1/knowledge/upload-and-ask`. Imports are content-addressed with SHA-256:
an existing hash is returned unchanged and only new content is inserted. Imported
documents become training candidates and require staff approval before use.

Full-text search can use an active JSON thesaurus. Staff can import Apache Solr-style
synonym files through `POST /api/v1/thesauri/upload` with `source_format=solr_synonyms`
or post normalized JSON to `POST /api/v1/thesauri`. Equivalent Solr lines such as
`cpu, processor` expand in both directions; explicit mappings such as
`usa => united states, america` expand only from the left side. The stored JSON can be
listed with `GET /api/v1/thesauri` and exported with `GET /api/v1/thesauri/{id}.json`.
`GET /api/v1/search` applies active thesauri by default and exposes the applied
`query_expansion` terms in the response for auditability.

Hybrid retrieval now combines PostgreSQL web-search ranking, dependency-free BM25,
and semantic vector retrieval. Discipline profiles can weight the three channels as
`full_text`, `bm25`, and `semantic`. Staff can export project vocabulary from approved
knowledge through `GET /api/v1/knowledge/vocab.txt` or
`GET /api/v1/knowledge/vocabulary.json`; the local mBERT and LSTM training scripts
accept `--vocab-file` so model artifacts record the project vocabulary used.

Knowledge imports run a trusted-source fact-check step before approval. The check
uses `INTERNET_SEARCH_ENDPOINT`, `INTERNET_SEARCH_API_KEY`, and
`TRUSTED_FACT_SOURCE_DOMAINS`; when no endpoint is configured the import is marked
for manual review rather than silently trusted.

The HTML5 frontend includes a GitHub-style administrator login with optional TOTP,
TOTP enrollment controls, thesaurus import, vocabulary export links, chat bubbles,
`@chatbot` room replies, score/research sharing fields, and a practice/real exam
submission mask. Real-exam submission asks for confirmation, hashes the gathered
answers and uploaded-file metadata, requests a confirmation token, and submits the
signed evidence package through the existing REST submission flow.

`POST /api/v1/audio/transcribe` uses an administrator-approved, freely available
Whisper model on CPU. Its transcript can be used as a research question or an exam
answer draft. Model IDs, timeouts, scoring weights, AdamW settings, authentication
modes, signature algorithms, and certificate defaults are environment settings.
Model availability is not permission to ingest arbitrary Internet material: staff
must verify copyright, license, provenance, privacy, and consent.

The Compose `training` profile runs at exact 48-hour intervals; the Kubernetes job
runs at 02:00 every second calendar day. Only approved examples are used. The mBERT
and CPU LSTM pipelines record loss/score progress and use dropout, deterministic
sentence restructuring, shuffling, AdamW weight decay, smoothing/penalties, and
gradient clipping to reduce shortcut learning.

Run `python tools/run_test_reports.py` to create matching JSON and PDF reports with
functional results, durations, and the bundled utility microbenchmarks.

## Integrity review, notifications, and grading scales

An instructor can call `POST /api/v1/submissions/{id}/academic-integrity-check`.
The result stores separate Internet-similarity matches, basic APA author-year and
reference-section checks, optional LanguageTool-compatible grammar findings, and
the existing per-question fact-entailment/contradiction signals. Internet search
uses an administrator-configured JSON search endpoint and API key; the application
does not scrape search-engine pages. A similarity result is evidence for human
review, never an automatic plagiarism finding.

`POST /api/v1/training/start` requests immediate training in addition to the
48-hour schedule. Imported documents remain training candidates until approved.
mBERT and LSTM training use average validation/training loss for configurable early
stopping. `POST /api/v1/notifications/email` sends audited scoring or question-answer
notifications through an authenticated SMTP relay; message bodies are never placed
in audit details.

Users have a base role plus narrow explicit permissions. Reports show percentage,
ECTS, an indicative German numeric grade, British classification, and US letter/GPA.
European country entries expose ECTS as a common reference only. These values are
not credential equivalencies: each institution's published scale and ECTS
distribution table prevail.

## Topic groups, group exams, rules, MCQ, and XML

Instructors can call `POST /api/v1/courses/{course_id}/exam-groups/randomize` to
create balanced, randomly assigned chatrooms for dedicated exam topics. Supplying
the same seed reproduces an assignment for audit; omitting it creates a fresh secure
seed. Each group is connected to its course and examination.

For group examinations, an instructor registers an X.509 group certificate with
`PUT /api/v1/exam-groups/{id}/certificate`. Its chain must validate against an
enabled customer private PKI. The private key remains client-side. Submissions are
accepted only from group members and must be signed by the registered certificate.

Exam rule sets can be created as JSON or uploaded as a JSON rules file. They define
page limits, topic, citation policy, and normalized weights for context, design,
wording, and citations. Choice questions support single or multiple correct options
and optional penalized partial credit. Course exams are always stored in PostgreSQL
and can be exchanged through the versioned, entity-safe XML import/export endpoints;
XML exports intentionally contain no student submissions or private evidence.

Instructors can also create complete question-answer exams from a versioned JSON
file or from the `/admin` examination builder. The builder has entry fields for
question text, default/reference answer, points, keywords, facts, and choice options;
the `+ Add question` button appends the next question, `Download JSON` saves the
portable file, and `Create draft examination` imports it into PostgreSQL through
`POST /api/v1/courses/{course_id}/examinations/from-json`. The same JSON can be
uploaded with `POST /api/v1/courses/{course_id}/examinations/import.json` and
exported again with `GET /api/v1/examinations/{id}/export.json`.

Students can load released examinations by course in the main HTML5 page. Practice
exams are submitted through the existing signed submission flow and receive ASAG
feedback; real exams use the confirmation, hash, signature, and instructor-correction
workflow before results are returned.

The HTML5 masks now share a top-left menu frame. The course menu lists selectable
courses, chatrooms can be selected from the chat section, and administrator-only
links lead to import/export and user definition. The user-definition mask captures
user ID, name, email, optional matriculation number, password plus visible/hidden
confirmation fields, base role, explicit rights checkboxes, and create/cancel/help
actions. The examination execution mask loads examinations for the selected course,
renders each question with its points and answer field or multiple-choice checklist,
and shows practice ASAG results in a scoring window after each per-question submit.
The chat mask follows a WhatsApp-style layout with chatroom list, left/right bubbles,
plus-file attachment picker, and browser microphone dictation where available.
When browser speech recognition is unavailable, the microphone button records a
short phrase and sends it to the project's ASR endpoint. A neighboring audio-send
button sends the spoken phrase as an audio attachment to the selected chat. Messages
can also carry uploaded files; if the message mentions `@chatbot`, supported text,
PDF, JSON, Markdown, CSV, or audio attachments are extracted/transcribed and used as
additional context for the chatbot's research or grading-style response. The emoji
button opens a lightweight browser-side picker for quick insertion into the message
field.

## Production work still required

- Alembic migrations instead of automatic table creation
- Redis/NATS-backed WebSocket fan-out before multiple API replicas
- background jobs for ASR, embeddings, Chroma indexing, and virus scanning
- object storage for original documents and exam files
- calibrated per-discipline grading against teacher-labelled evaluation sets
- complete citation validation, ASR accuracy monitoring, and model-drift alerting
- retention rules, consent, accessibility testing, backups, and monitoring
